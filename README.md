Viamo is a telecom company that serves regions with low internet access in Africa, particularly Mali, Nigeria, and Uganda. Viamo is a platform to disperse crucial communication, news, weather forecasts, farming knowledge, financial news to regions in Africa that have no internet access. User behavior, demographics and content needs to be addressed to extend the reach and utility of the platform. 

Using BigQuery, data was pulled to answer specific questions about the user base. Call volumes during year, month, day, and hour within various demographics were analyzed. Message content topics were tabulated to inform Viamo of user behavior. Using K-Means and other clustering algorithms, I explored possible subscriber segments in Nigeria so that Viammo can target them for impoortant news across the country.
